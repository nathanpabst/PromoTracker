### About This Project
**Promo Tracker** is a business-level application for a large book company with the intent of reporting on and disseminating promotion code information to multiple departments including Sales, Customer Support, Finance, and Marketing. When a user from the Sales or Customer Support team visits the site they will see a list of active promotions and have the ability to view all of the details associated with a particular promotion that can, in turn, be shared with customers. Marketing and Finance users have access to an administrative page where they can add a new promotion and update or delete an existing promotion. The application also includes a reporting tab with two charts illustrating the key performance indicators that Finance and Marketing use to evaluate the overall performance and profitability of a campaign.
